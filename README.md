# XAuthConnect PHP Demo Client

This is a demonstration of the [oauth2-xauthconnect](https://github.com/xauth-ecosystem/oauth2-xauthconnect) library, a robust OAuth 2.0 client implementation for PHP.

This demo showcases integration with an XAuthConnect authorization server, leveraging the library for streamlined authentication and authorization flows, including OIDC Discovery.

## Features

- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow** with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
- **Token Management**: Access token, refresh token with automatic refresh
- **Complete Token Operations**:
  - Token refresh
  - Token introspection
  - Token revocation
  - User data retrieval
- **Session Management**: Automatic token validation and recovery
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Semantic UI-based responsive design

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- PHP extensions: `curl`, `json`, `session`
- XAuthConnect server running (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8010`)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Installation

To get started with the demo client, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xauth-ecosystem/xauthconnect-php-demo-client.git
   cd xauthconnect-php-demo-client
   ```

2. Install the dependencies using Composer:
   ```bash
   composer require xauth/oauth2-xauthconnect
   ```

3. Configure the client by editing the `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `redirectUri`, and `issuer` parameters in `client.php`:
   ```php
   $provider = new XAuthConnectProvider([
       'clientId'     => 'test_client_123',
       'clientSecret' => 'test_secret_key',
       'redirectUri'  => 'http://127.0.0.1:8081/client.php',
       'issuer'       => 'http://127.0.0.1:8010',
   ]);
   ```

4. Start a PHP development server:
   ```bash
   php -S 127.0.0.1:8081
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8081/client.php
   ```

## Configuration

Client credentials (`clientId`, `clientSecret`) and the `redirectUri` must be configured in `client.php` within the `XAuthConnectProvider` constructor. The `issuer` URL should point to your XAuthConnect authorization server instance.

## Usage

### Initial Authorization

1. Click the "Authorize" button
2. Log in on the XAuthConnect server
3. You'll be redirected back with an access token

### Token Operations

Once authorized, you can:

- **Refresh Token**: Get a new access token using the refresh token
- **Fetch User Data**: Retrieve user profile information
- **Introspect Token**: Check token status and metadata
- **Revoke Token**: Invalidate a token on the server
- **Logout**: End the session and clear all tokens

### Automatic Token Management

The client library handles token expiration and refresh automatically when using the provided methods.

## Security Features

- **PKCE Implementation**: Protects against authorization code interception
- **State Parameter**: Prevents CSRF attacks
- **Secure Token Storage**: Session-based token management
- **Automatic Token Validation**: Server-side token verification

```

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid state or code_verifier" Error

- Ensure session is properly maintained, as the `oauth2-xauthconnect` library relies on it for PKCE and state parameters.
- Check that the redirect URI exactly matches the registered URI in your `client.php` configuration and on the authorization server.
- Verify that cookies are enabled in your browser.

### Token Refresh Failures

- If the `oauth2-xauthconnect` library fails to refresh the token, check if the refresh token itself has expired or been revoked.
- Verify client credentials (`clientId`, `clientSecret`) are correct in `client.php`.
- Ensure the XAuthConnect server is running and accessible.

### Connection Issues

- Verify the `issuer` URL in your `client.php` configuration is correct.
- Check that the authorization server is accessible from where the demo client is running.
- Review PHP error logs for details from the `oauth2-xauthconnect` library or cURL errors.

## Development

### Testing Different Scenarios

You can test various OAuth flows:

1. **Normal Flow**: Complete authorization and use tokens
2. **Token Expiration**: Wait for token to expire and observe auto-refresh
3. **Manual Refresh**: Use the refresh button before expiration
4. **Token Revocation**: Revoke tokens and re-authorize
5. **Session Recovery**: Close browser and return to test session persistence

### Customization

The interface uses Semantic UI and can be easily customized:

- Modify CSS in the `<style>` section of `templates/header.php`
- Update text and labels throughout the HTML templates
